Command: cd
1. No arguments
```
Andres-MacBook-Air:lecture1 AndreGiske$ pwd
/Users/AndreGiske/Desktop/lecture1
Andres-MacBook-Air:lecture1 AndreGiske$ cd
Andres-MacBook-Air:~ AndreGiske$ pwd
/Users/AndreGiske
```
With no arguments, cd brought me to my own user directory called AndreGiske. The previous working directory was /Users/AndreGiske/Desktop/lecture1. New directory is /Users/AndreGiske
This is because cd is used to change into different directories, but with no arguments it changes to the users directory.
The output is not an error.

2. Directory argument
```
Andres-MacBook-Air:~ AndreGiske$ pwd
/Users/AndreGiske
Andres-MacBook-Air:~ AndreGiske$ cd Desktop
Andres-MacBook-Air:Desktop AndreGiske$ pwd
/Users/AndreGiske/Desktop
```
With the directory called Desktop as an argument, it brought me to the directory called Desktop. The previous working directory was /Users/AndreGiske. New directory is /Users/AndreGiske/Desktop.
This is because using a directory as an argument will change the directory into the given argument.
The output is not an error.

3. File argument
```
Andres-MacBook-Air:lecture1 AndreGiske$ pwd
/Users/AndreGiske/Desktop/lecture1
Andres-MacBook-Air:lecture1 AndreGiske$ cd Hello.java
bash: cd: Hello.java: Not a directory
Andres-MacBook-Air:lecture1 AndreGiske$ pwd
/Users/AndreGiske/Desktop/lecture1
```
With the file called Hello.java as an argument, it could not complete this command and tells me that Hello.java is not a directory. The previous working directory was /Users/AndreGiske/Desktop/lecture1. New directory is the same.
This is because cd only works with directories, not files.
The output is not an error.

Command: ls
1. No arguments
```
Andres-MacBook-Air:lecture1 AndreGiske$ pwd
/Users/AndreGiske/Desktop/lecture1
Andres-MacBook-Air:lecture1 AndreGiske$ ls
Hello.class     Hello.java      README          messages
Andres-MacBook-Air:lecture1 AndreGiske$ pwd
/Users/AndreGiske/Desktop/lecture1
```
With no arguments, ls showed all the files in my current working directory. The previous directory was /Users/AndreGiske/Desktop/lecture1. New directory is the same.
This is because the ls command shows all files in the current working directory.
The output is not an error.

2. Directory argument
```
Andres-MacBook-Air:~ AndreGiske$ pwd
/Users/AndreGiske
Andres-MacBook-Air:~ AndreGiske$ ls Desktop

Andres-MacBook-Air:~ AndreGiske$ pwd
/Users/AndreGiske
```
With Desktop as an argument, ls showed all the file names the Desktop directory. The previous directory was /Users/AndreGiske. New directory is the same.
This is because the ls command can show files in the given input directory.
The output is not an error.

3. File argument
```
Andres-MacBook-Air:lecture1 AndreGiske$ pwd
/Users/AndreGiske/Desktop/lecture1
Andres-MacBook-Air:lecture1 AndreGiske$ ls Hello.java
Hello.java
Andres-MacBook-Air:lecture1 AndreGiske$ pwd
/Users/AndreGiske/Desktop/lecture1
```
With Hello.java as an argument, ls printed Hello.java again. The previous directory was /Users/AndreGiske/Desktop/lecture1. New directory is the same.
This is because there are no further files in the Hello.java file, therefore it prints out the same file name.
The output is not an error.

Command: cat
1. No arguments
```
Andres-MacBook-Air:lecture1 AndreGiske$ pwd
/Users/AndreGiske/Desktop/lecture1
Andres-MacBook-Air:lecture1 AndreGiske$ cat
input
input
```
With no arguments the terminal returned the inputs you give. The previous directory was /Users/AndreGiske/Desktop/lecture1.
This is because there are no arguments describing which file it should read, therefore it just reads the inputs.
The output is not an error.

2. Directory argument
```
Andres-MacBook-Air:Desktop AndreGiske$ pwd
/Users/AndreGiske/Desktop
Andres-MacBook-Air:Desktop AndreGiske$ cat lecture1
cat: lecture1: Is a directory
Andres-MacBook-Air:Desktop AndreGiske$ pwd
/Users/AndreGiske/Desktop
```
With lecture1 as the directory argument, it does not complete the command and tells me that lecture1 is a directory. The previous directory was /Users/AndreGiske/Desktop. New directory is the same.
This is because the command cat does not work on directories, only files, therefore there is an error.
The output is not an error.

3. File argument
```
Andres-MacBook-Air:lecture1 AndreGiske$ pwd
/Users/AndreGiske/Desktop/lecture1
Andres-MacBook-Air:lecture1 AndreGiske$ cat Hello.java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Path;

public class Hello {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
    String content = Files.readString(Path.of(args[0]), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);    
    System.out.println(content);
  }
}Andres-MacBook-Air:lecture1 AndreGiske$ pwd
/Users/AndreGiske/Desktop/lecture1
```
With Hello.java as the file argument, it reads all the files contents. The previous directory was /Users/AndreGiske/Desktop/lecture1. The new directory is the same.
This is because cat command reads the contents of a file you input.
The output is not an error.
